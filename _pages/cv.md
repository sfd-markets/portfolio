# Site Reliability Engineer.

## Technical Skills
Cloud, Virtualization, Ansible, Automation, Cyber Security

### Certifications
- CCSP
- OSCP

## SRE Cloud
- Management of employees, tasks, projects and day-to-day Private Cloud IT operations
- Lead on major escalations and incidents in the Virtualization plant
- Implemented automated processes to improve efficiency and reliability
        - Adopted Ansible within IT operations and deployed playbooks to reduce TOIL
        - Created Splunk Dashboards used for troubleshooting issues and providing visibility to the different siloed programs and senior management
- Implement security measures to protect against cyber threats
        - Lead in reviewing and implementing IAM within the Virtualization Operations space. Scoped out the necessary entitlements to administer the Virtual infrastructure Privileged Access Management Environment
        - Server hardening of ESXi Hypervisors and deployment of vAppliances (Proxy,DLP,AV)
-  Conduct and collaborate on regular security audits and vulnerability assessments, in compliance with frameworks as NIST-800-53 and NIST-800-37
- Ongoing production of Observability program that correlates and analyzes telemetry metrics taken from our Private cloud plant to provide stability. This involved using prometheus and grafana to help identify and illustrate resource constraints. In our hyper-converged cloud this helped correlate latency in our storage and compute stack

## Infrastructure Consultant
Worked on campaign of adopting users from using Physical machines to Virtualized infrastructure
        - This meant the evaluation of user requirements and reviewing performance and benchmark metrics of server and application performance
        - This translated into saving +25% in data center space and cost reduction. In addition it helped streamline the maintenance for those machines contributing to the cost cutting effort.
- Ran the encryption program of keeping the Virtual Data center and its components compliant
- Modernize IT infrastructure by building Defense-in-Depth Datacenter, and implementing iSCSI storage ability in our plant
        - DiD: added more security to our infrastructure, by segregating datacenters and encryption safe guarding PII and compliance standards of ISO-27001.
        - iSCSI: added more features to our infrastructure teams to offer better performance and reliability to various applications
- To improve our troubleshooting efficiency and prevent recurrences, I was tasked with developing SLI's and SLO's improving resolution times and monitoring coverage. A common recurring issue was resource constraints, such as high CPU utilization, memory contention, and I/O bottlenecks. Ensuring these metrics were monitored and a call to action clearly defined for those responding reduced any TOIL at this lower tier space realizing the company significant savings (~30%)
